**Speed Booster Pack is a lightweight, frequently updated, easy to use and well supported plugin which allows you to improve your website's loading speed.**

Improving your site's speed will get you a better score on major speed testing services such as [Google PageSpeed](http://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), [GTmetrix](http://gtmetrix.com/), [YSlow](https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/), [Pingdom](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/), [Webpagetest](http://www.webpagetest.org/) and will also improve your overall site's usability. This will persuade Google and other search engines to rank your site higher in search results thus sending more traffic.

= Why Site Speed Is Important? =

Visitors usually close a website if it doesn't load in a few seconds and the slower a site loads the greater the chances are that the visitors will leave. And you don't want that to happen, do you? :-)
Speed Booster Pack is a plugin that can help you speed up your website by tweaking different options.

= Main Plugin Features =

* **Eliminate external render-blocking javascript and css** in above-the-fold content.
* **Move scripts to the footer** to improve page loading speed.
* **Load CSS asynchronously** to render your page more quickly and get a higher score on the major speed testing services.
* **Minify and inline all CSS styles and move them to the footer** to eliminate external render-blocking CSS and optimize CSS delivery.
* ** Minify HTML and JavaScript to increase your page load speed.
* **Change image compression level** to keep file sizes smaller; Change JPG quality.
* **Load javascript files from Google Libraries** rather than serving them from your WordPress install directly, to reduce latency, increase parallelism and improve browser caching.
* **Defer parsing of javascript files** to reduce the initial load time of your page.
* **Remove query strings from static resources** to improve your speed scores.
* **Remove extra Font Awesome stylesheets** added to your theme by certain plugins, if *Font Awesome* is already used in your theme.
* **Remove junk header tags** to clean up your WordPress Header.
* **Display page loading time** in the plugin options page.
* **Display the number of executed SQL queries** in the plugin options page.
* **Display the Peak Memory Used** in the plugin options page.
* **Exclude scripts** from being moved to the footer or defered.
* **Remove RSD Link** if you are not using a Weblog Client or some 3rd party sites/programs that use the XML-RPC request formats.
* **Remove WordPress Shortlink**
* **Remove the WordPress Version** this option is added for security reasons and cleaning the header.
* **Remove all rss feed links** to cleanup your WordPress header.

* For complete usage instructions visit [Plugin Documentation](http://docs.machothemes.com/category/118-speed-booster)


Future Development:

* Enable compression option.
* Leverage browser caching.
* Option to disable specific plugin actions on specific pages directly via the page edit screen metabox.
* Option to keep specific scripts in the header, since there are many javascript-based plugins scripts, that rely on jQuery to be loaded prior to the HTML elements.

= Recommended Plugins =

* [Simple Author Box](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-author-box/) - A simple but cool author box with social icons.
